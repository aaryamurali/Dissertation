The experimental phone was connected to the car via Bluetooth. The dialling mode was by voice. Participants did not take their hands off the steering wheel. All the participants dialled the same number and did the same tasks, respectively. The experimental conditions was follows:

 (1)   Single task: Driving and reverse bay parking without phone use.

(2)   Dual task: Driving and reverse bay parking while talking on the phone.

  Dual task: The dual task is split into two parts: (1) easy task and (2) hard task.
 

1)      Easy task is “Count from 50 up to 200”

 

2)      Hard task is “Count backwards from 100 and take away 3 each time.”

Each journal has a different hypothesis. The data is meant to produce desired result.

JOURNAL 1

You need Theta, Lower Alpha, HR, Age, BP, Gender and Performance for the ML.

Hypo

“If the average Theta and Lower Alpha frequency band, HR and BP are higher for the hard task than easy task, the subject is considered as cognitively loaded, eliciting poor performance. Whereas If the average Theta and Lower Alpha frequency band, HR and BP are lower for the hard task than easy task, the subject is considered as not cognitively loaded, eliciting good performance”

JOURNAL 2

You need HR, Age, BP, Gender and Performance for the ML.

Hypo

“If the HR and BP are higher for the hard task than easy task, the subject is considered as cognitively loaded, eliciting poor performance. Whereas If the HR and BP are lower for the hard task than easy task, the subject is considered as not cognitively loaded, eliciting good performance”

JOURNAL 3

You need HR, Age, Gender and Performance for the ML.

Hypo

“If the HR is higher for the hard task than easy task, the subject is considered as cognitively loaded, eliciting poor performance. Whereas If the HR is lower for the hard task than easy task, the subject is considered as not cognitively loaded, eliciting good performance”
